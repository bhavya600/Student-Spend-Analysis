## Problem Statement

There are many stores in which a survey was conducted 
based on students i.e. 
how much they are spending on different kind of purchases 
like Video games, Indoor games, Toys, 
Books, Gadgets etc. In the data set (Student Survey), Store 
setting is the column that explains the Type 
of location in which the store is present. By using data set 
(Student Survey), try to extract the 
meaningful Insights. 
 
Data set - Student survey 
 
Problem Statement- Create a Power BI Report: 
 
1. Tabular Visualization - Format the total amount of 
purchase (TAP) based on ‘Store location’ and ‘Store 
setting’: - 
 If 0<TAP<35000, then records should be in red color 
 If 35000<=TAP<60000, then records should be in yellow 
color 
 If TAP>=60000, then records should be in Blue color
